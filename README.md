# Introducing the Whaleshares Blockchain

The Whaleshares Blockchain is a Delegated Proof of Stake blockchain based on the Steem blockchain. Whaleshares was created to create a more decentralized platform and limit some of the widespread corruption found on the original. Whaleshares will function essentially the same as Steem aside from some key differences such as security problems that will be fixed and changing certain key elements to minimize corruption. We plan to provide multiple front-ends for the chain as well as incorporating a decentralized exchange connected to the bitshares platform in lieu of an internal market.
